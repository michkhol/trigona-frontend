          <p>&quot;Practical Change Management&quot; is an immersive, live web-based training that equips professionals to effectively lead change from a people perspective to ensure transformation&apos;s success. Through an interactive and applied approach, participants gain a deep understanding of change management activities, timing, and alignment to functional milestones that account for limited resource availability and generally condensed timing of a project. Participants will receive a distilled, down-to-earth approach, activity lists, templates, and frameworks supercharged with AI, applicable for any type of organization and transformations. The program is designed to help people navigate the human aspect of change and ways to make it successful.</p>
